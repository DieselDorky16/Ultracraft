Welcome to Ultracraft <br>

<h4>Warnings and Notes</h4>
* This mod pack is the replacement of EnhancedCraft, as it broke in 1.16, making it discontinued. However, it's not an update of Enhancedcraft. This is a different modpack that uses some blocks from that mod.
* Please note this README is also a change log.
* This mod also changes the default textures for Vanilla Minecraft. Please be aware that some textures may look different than normal. This is to fix any parity issues in Vanilla Minecraft.
* Requires latest version of 1.16.1 Forge Beta
* Report any issues on the bug tracker on GitHub, please. Don't use JIRA.
